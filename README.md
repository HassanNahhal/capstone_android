# Receipt Keeper

Receipt Keeper will allow users to track how much money they spent in a certain category over a specific number of months, as well as start a group which others can be invited to join, and this will allow group admins to see reports for the group. Receipt Keeper is built to work on Android devices and also include a web app. The mobile application will make it easier for people to manage categories, tags and reports while having the convenience of scanning receipts wherever they are. The web application provides the list of receipts and shows graphs to visualize user’s spending.
